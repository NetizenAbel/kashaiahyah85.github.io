# The Technocratic Revolution
A co-operative social design based upon educated agreements.

### Forward

#### Standing for a Cause
> We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. When the loyal opposition dies, I think the soul of America dies with it.
â€• Edward R. Murrow

In as much as it has been used to refer to the violent uprisings throughout all time, revolution describes something altogether wrong, and by any account. There is no need for any violence in this particular revolution; because the goals of this new society are wholely incompatible with shows of force. I write this because we are, at this time in 2020 AD, at a crossroads of time. We can either move one step forward, or else be forced two steps back. As capitalist democracy obeyed the theories of individual greed, this society is intended to emerge naturally from the situations provided for. Without space for opinionated denials of demonstrable truths.

Is this as extreme as dying for the sake of a very faulty document? No, no it is not. I had no intention of any revolution before November of 2019, when the ongoing outbreak and eventual pandemic of the novel coronavirus which arose in Asia. Had the individual states been able to self-govern fully and direct common resources by agreement between the individual states, some may have averted said disaster. Instead, they found themselves pitted against one another for the entertainment of a federated criminal enterprise. A bully system to be left in our past, as with all childish things of ours. 

Instead, we of the States of America recieved arrogance, lies, and politics. All of which have been the root cause of an avoidable disaster of a scale to match the hubris of man. We have proven that our gigantic herd mentality has become incredibly toxic - deadly even. For we have again witnessed the scourge of Nazi ideals such as Nationalism and racial supremecy, which were said to have been defeated by war. But a psychology cannot be destroyed by war, and those who lost the physical war only went into hiding among the rest.

#### The Eagle has Died.
As it stands today, Saturday May 9th of 2020, we have not yet acknowledged that the Union is no longer, and that there are now two organically formed groups. The first group is largely gathered in the center of the continent, and is smaller in number. These are the ones who deliberately seem to reach after dictatorships in the name of a document they do not read. 

I myself am clearly of the second group; the ones who are willing to defy this current federal, and criminal, _enterprise_. The Governers, such as Washington's Jay Inslee who has not bent to the "Absolute Authority" the 45th President has declared he does have. We do not bend to false Authority, despite the titles. 

#### Authority Damned.
There is no authority above the Truth, and there is none who can give authority in that to a liar. Because we have shown that we will attempt to do so in the name of an obsession with excesses, and a misconception as to law. We have certainly fallen into destruction.

That is why I have written this. If it is achieved, I will be insignificant in that process. If it is attempted, and not achieved, I will be labeled evil. But this is the way of things from the start.


### Okay, Interesting. How would this work?
Though I do not in any way suggest that these should be the names ultimately used; but they are descriptive enough to set a tone.

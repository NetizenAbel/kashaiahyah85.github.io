# The Technocratic Revolution
A co-operative social design based upon educated agreements.

###### Isn't Revolution a little extreme?
As extreme as dying for the sake of a very faulty document? No, no it is not. I had no intention of any revolution before November of 2019, when the ongoing outbreak and eventual pandemic of the novel coronavirus which arose in Asia. Had the individual states been able to self-govern fully and direct common resources by agreement between the individual states, some may have averted said disaster. 

Instead, we of the States of America recieved arrogance, lies, and politics. We have proven that our gigantic herd mentality has become incredibly toxic - deadly even. For we have again witnessed the scourge of Nazi ideals such as Nationalism and racial supremecy, which were said to have been defeated by war. But a psychology cannot be destroyed by war, and those who lost the physical war only went into hiding among the rest.

###### The Eagle has Died.
As it stands today, Saturday May 9th of 2020, we have not yet acknowledged that the Union is no longer, and that there are now two organically formed groups. The first group is largely gathered in the center of the continent, and is smaller in number. These are the ones who deliberately seem to reach after dictatorships in the name of a document they do not read. 

I myself am clearly of the second group; the ones who are willing to defy this current federal, and criminal, _enterprise_. The Governers, such as Washington's Jay Inslee who has not bent to the "Absolute Authority" the 45th President has declared he does have. We do not bend to false Authority, despite the titles. 

###### Authority Damned
There is no authority above the Truth, and there is none who can give authority in that to a liar. Because we have shown that we will attempt to do so in the name of an obsession with excesses, and a misconception as to law. We have certainly fallen into destruction.

That is why I have written this. If it is achieved, I will be insignificant in that process. If it is attempted, and not achieved, I will be labeled evil. But this is the way of things from the start.

### How would this work?
Though I do not in any way suggest that these should be the names ultimately used; but they are descriptive enough to set a tone.
